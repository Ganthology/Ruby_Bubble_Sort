# Bubble sort
This is a small project from The Odin project. The project is to implement bubble sort algorithm using Ruby language.
## Small summary
1. Bubble sort algorithm is to always compare with next, repeat until last one is fixed. The loops needed is n-1 for n size array. The next loop will decrease the size by 1, so the size is n - i - 1. 
2. There is a convenient way in Ruby to swap values of 2 variables which is ```array[j], array[j+1] = array[j+1], array[j]```.
